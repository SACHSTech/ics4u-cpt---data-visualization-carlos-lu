*This csv features the rank of top sellig games in steam, PC - only.*

Above csv is the only csv file we are going to use for this CPT, "best selling..." is not part of the deal.

In this JavaFX file, we have CSV read using scanner and encapsulate them into a method object.

In the games.java, it is a encapsulation of a object, it is used to sort each words into its own specific variable.
